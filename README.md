# GeoMath [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmesel/GeoMath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmesel/GeoMath)

Library that enables Python Users to use concepts of Analytical Geometry!

Classes available for usage:

  * Point
    * Point(a,b)
    * distance(self,point_two)
    * midpoint(self,point_two)
  * Figure
    * squarearea(a)
    * Barycenter


Classes that we are working on:
 - Three Points alignment (This function require Sarrus Law, this function will be implemented with the help of NumPy)
 - Linear Coeficient and Angular Coeficient
 - Deployment on PIP
 - Equation solver for getting angular and linear coeficient

If you want to contribute, fork it into a REPO and help us develop this tool for everyone!
